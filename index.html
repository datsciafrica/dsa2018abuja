<p>Since 2015, Data Science Africa (DSA) has held an annual summer school and workshop to train participants on machine learning and data science methods and provide an avenue for researchers to present work demonstrating the application of these techniques to problems relevant in the African context.
</p>

<p>For 2018, DSA is expanding to West Africa with <strong>DSA 2018 Abuja in Nigeria 12th to 16th November.</strong> To consolidating DSA efforts in East Africa,  DSA will also have a <strong>DSA 2018 Nyeri in Kenya, and May 31st to June 8th</strong>.  DSA 2018 Abuja will take DSA’s traditional structure of a three days Summer School and a Two Day workshop, while DSA 2018 Abuja will instead of a three day summer school have a six (6) days “training of Trainers” and a two day workshop.
